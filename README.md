# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
In this analysis, a summary and multiple-line graph are created to display ride-sharing data by city type. Cities were placed into one of three categories: "Urban", "Suburban", and "Rural". This analysis was created to make financial data-driven-decisions at PyBer.

## Results:
The dataFrame provides a broad, generalized, representation of the data. From the table below, it is shown that there is a large volume increase the closer to cities. There are also many more drivers within urban settings. The further from cities, the fewer rides, drivers, and total fares, and an increase in Averages of fare per ride and dare per driver. Urban cities also generate much more revenue while the least for average fare per driver.

The line graph provides a more detailed look with the metrics of total fare in a short time span by city type. This time period is from Jan 2019 - April 2019. From the chart below, it is shown that urban cities generate more revenue in fare. 

### Multiple-Line Graph

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary:
There are some potential disparities that will need to be taken into account when using this data to make business decisions.
* Though there is a correlation between number of drivers and revenue, it should not be assumed that simply encouraging more drivers in rural areas will increase profits.
* The high average fare per ride and average fare per driver in rural cities might be because locations are more spaced out geographically and, therefore cost more because of the greater distance.
* In rural cities, there is probably a lesser demand for ride-sharing services than in urban cities where not owning a car is more common.

More research will need to be done in order to make better decisions.

Possible impovements:
* population of cities
* travel distance
* fare per mile
* population / rides
* presence of competetive ride-sharing companies
